[2023-12-28 18:36:05] Mefn: nice house
[2023-12-28 18:36:20] Fakas: thanks
[2023-12-28 18:48:59] Fakas: ooer that's a bit weird
[2023-12-28 18:58:12] Fakas: aight that works
[2023-12-28 19:00:00] Fakas: me when I set fire to a living creature for my amusement
[2023-12-28 19:00:17] Mefn: he is dead in TTT
[2023-12-28 19:00:51] Fakas: is there a reason you're committing this hate crime against my frame times
[2023-12-28 19:00:59] Mefn: yes
[2023-12-28 19:02:13] Fakas: oh right this
[2023-12-28 19:03:24] Mefn: get lmaoed
[2023-12-28 19:04:39] Fakas: omg cheater
[2023-12-28 19:04:46] Mefn: omg
[2023-12-28 19:05:04] Fakas: oh right let's test this
[2023-12-28 19:05:51] Fakas: need you to die babe <3
[2023-12-28 19:06:03] Fakas: nice
[2023-12-28 19:06:04] Fakas: it works
[2023-12-28 19:06:22] Fakas: you get a corpse and a ghost
[2023-12-28 19:06:34] Fakas: oh that's a point
[2023-12-28 19:07:08] Fakas: nice
[2023-12-28 19:07:16] Fakas: atlases properly stay with you on death
[2023-12-28 19:07:28] Mefn: good
[2023-12-28 19:07:44] Fakas: rain kinda ruining the test I wanted to do on moisture here ngl
[2023-12-28 19:08:21] Mefn: tfw no weather commands
[2023-12-28 19:08:38] Mefn: aslo I can't hear you
[2023-12-28 19:08:43] Fakas: so
[2023-12-28 19:08:45] Mefn: nor do I have any game sound
[2023-12-28 19:08:46] Fakas: there are weather commands
[2023-12-28 19:08:50] Fakas: but minecraft is fucking stupid
[2023-12-28 19:08:58] Fakas: when rain starts it sets a point in the future to wear off
[2023-12-28 19:09:04] Fakas: and at that point, it just toggles the weather
[2023-12-28 19:09:08] Fakas: so if you manually de-rain it
[2023-12-28 19:09:19] Fakas: it will, some point in the near future, re-rain because the time limit on rain ran out
[2023-12-28 19:09:27] Mefn: classic
[2023-12-28 19:10:16] Fakas: these dragonskeletons are way too frequent
[2023-12-28 19:10:23] Mefn: yes
[2023-12-28 19:10:24] Fakas: I'm gonna have to double check that because I thought I fixed it
[2023-12-28 19:12:12] Fakas: huh
[2023-12-28 19:12:13] Fakas: oh well
[2023-12-28 19:14:32] Mefn: bro did you *increase* the dragon corpse spawn rate
[2023-12-28 19:14:37] Fakas: possibly
[2023-12-28 19:14:44] Fakas: some mods do things weirdly
[2023-12-28 19:14:58] Fakas: like they'll say "spawn rate" but lower values mean more for some reason
[2023-12-28 19:15:10] Mefn: there's like 9 of them here
[2023-12-28 19:17:13] Fakas: I wonder how the server will feel about this :)
[2023-12-28 19:17:20] Mefn: about what
[2023-12-28 19:17:33] Mefn: yeah
[2023-12-28 19:18:11] Mefn: doin p good
[2023-12-28 19:18:50] Fakas: honestly yeah all things considered this isn't bad
[2023-12-28 19:19:10] Mefn: gettomg secpmds per frame but still good
[2023-12-28 19:19:38] Fakas: damb we made london-level pollution
[2023-12-28 19:20:18] Mefn: my favourite part of the pollution mod is the sky slowly filling up with it as mobs die to the day/night cycle
[2023-12-28 19:20:38] Fakas: that should happen less now since I've disabled mob death causing pollution
[2023-12-28 19:20:43] Mefn: big cave pogger
[2023-12-28 19:20:44] Fakas: oh I think it's done
[2023-12-28 19:21:41] Fakas: aaand we're back to 20tps
[2023-12-28 19:21:44] Fakas: not bad tbh
[2023-12-28 19:21:45] Mefn: nice
[2023-12-28 19:22:27] Fakas: yeah see this doesn't pollute anymore
[2023-12-28 19:22:57] Mefn: good
[2023-12-28 19:23:16] Fakas: it was a feature not a bug of the mod but it's one I've now turned off
[2023-12-28 19:23:46] Mefn: it was fine, it just filled the sky with dark bits that never go away
[2023-12-28 19:24:00] Fakas: they should go away after a while
[2023-12-28 19:24:07] Fakas: pollution does eventually dissipate
[2023-12-28 19:24:12] Mefn: big claims
[2023-12-28 19:26:05] Fakas: you're in creative
[2023-12-28 19:26:18] Mefn: they've targetted while it creative before
[2023-12-28 19:26:28] Fakas: yeah but I've turned that off
[2023-12-28 19:26:32] Mefn: good
[2023-12-28 19:26:43] Mefn: what about their stupid spawn rate
[2023-12-28 19:26:51] Fakas: should b p low
[2023-12-28 19:27:13] Mefn: get lmaoed
[2023-12-28 19:27:20] Fakas: good
[2023-12-28 19:28:07] Fakas: I'm not seeing wild towers everywhere so that seems to have been fixed at least
[2023-12-28 19:28:37] Fakas: the structures from born in chaos are still way too common though
[2023-12-28 19:29:02] Mefn: yeah
[2023-12-28 19:29:36] Fakas: aight well I'm fucking off
[2023-12-28 19:29:37] Fakas: see ya
